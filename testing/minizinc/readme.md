# MiniZinc Examples

These are examples I did only to get acquainted with the language. Most of these examples come from the [MiniZinc Handbook](https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.5.3/en/index.html), other examples are from the coursera course.

 - *manual-examples*: these are the examples in the MiniZinc Handbook manual;
 - *puzzles*: these are solutions for puzzles taken from the internet or puzzle books.
